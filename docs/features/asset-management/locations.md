# Locations 

Locations are virtual constructs used to manage assets on locations. Locations are structured hierarchically and can have sublocations. The structure of locations is static, i.e. locations can't change place. Assets can be installed at a location and, as required, can be moved to other location later.

Asset costs always follow the location of the asset. In other words, if you install an asset on a new location, the asset automatically uses the financial dimensions that are related to the new location.

> The way that you build your hierarchy of functional locations depends on your company's requirements for maintaining internal equipment or servicing customer equipment. 

Here are some examples of configuring locations based on company's working model:

- **Functional** – The functional locations can be user-oriented and used to manage assets that have similar behavior.
- **Process-related** – The functional locations can be workflow-oriented.
- **Spatial** – The functional locations can represent geographical locations or sites.

The following figure shows an example of functional locations that are based on geographical locations.
