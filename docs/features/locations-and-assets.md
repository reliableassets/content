# Locations and assets

Functional locations are used to manage assets on locations. This management includes tracking of asset costs on functional locations. Functional locations are structured hierarchically, and locations can have sublocations. The structure of functional locations is static. In other words, locations can't change place. Assets can be installed on functional locations and, as required, can be installed on other functional locations later.

Asset costs always follow the location of the asset. In other words, if you install an asset on a new functional location, the asset automatically uses the financial dimensions that are related to the new functional location. Therefore, asset costs are always related to the functional location that the asset is currently installed on. This automatic handling of financial dimensions helps guarantee complete tracking of costs when your company does project controlling and reporting on functional locations.

> The way that you build your hierarchy of functional locations depends on your company's requirements for maintaining internal equipment or servicing customer equipment.
